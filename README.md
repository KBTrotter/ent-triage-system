# AI-Assisted ENT Triage System
ENT clinics deal with a high volume of patients seeking appointments and help for anything from an emergency to a routine check-up. Front desk staff are responsible for triaging calls, or determining the urgency of their treatment, in order to schedule appointments accordingly. Triaging may be difficult or inaccurate as the front desk staff are not equipped with the same medical knowledge as the practitioners of the clinic.

Our project's objective is to develop an AI-Assisted Triage System for ENT clinics which automates collecting and triaging patient information. The goal is to build an AI-powered  agent that can gather information from the patient on the phone, categorize their case by urgency, and provide immediate guidance if needed. The staff can access an integrated dashboard to view and update cases, allowing them to efficiently review and schedule appointments with the help of the intelligence provided by the AI. This would significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of the clinic to see urgent cases, alleviate the burden of manual triaging on frontline staff, and reduce scheduling wait times for patients.
